12.November.2016: Release 4.9.0.1
         Thanks: Matt Rioux has reported some bugs and quirks that are fixed in this release.
		 Bug: LiveWorkFlow now works again.  The issue was the migration of schema to 
		          https://github.com/EARTHTIME/Schema in 2015 and a failure on my part
				  to fully update Tripoli. Please inform me of issues when you experience
				  them, and send money if you can, as we are working on fumes.
		 Info: For LiveWorkFlow, data columns (ratios, etc.) must have unique names or
		          Tripoli gets confused when saving and updating.

		Feature:  Bulk re-corrections now restore the "tripolized" state of the data including
		                  discards and statistical outliers.

16.January.2011: Release 4.6.3.01
		Bugs:      Miscellaneous bugs fixed. 
		Bugs:      Noah McLean discovered a known Microsoft bug related to a ".csv" file starting 
		                with "ID" : the ID-TIMS data import template (see tools) has been adjusted accordingly.
		
		Community:  Please visit our CIRDLES.org website and join the discussions or report a bug
		
		Feature:     Tripoli now supports bulk re-fractionation correction using a different tracer
		                    from the tracer used in the saved ".trip" file.  Of course you then need to re-export
		                    the results to ET_Redux.
							
		Feature:     Tripoli now supports oxide correction when the tracer contains U236.

		Bugs:		Miscellaneous bugs fixed.  Fixed date reader for Triton .exp files to handle
		                dd.mm.yyyy format in addition to the original mm/dd/yyyy format.

20.March.2010: Release 4.6.2.60
		News:		Noah McLean has updated our logo and icon ... please enjoy!
		
		Note:		The changes embodied in this release derive from 2 year's experience at MIT and
					other labs.  Tripoli has successfully migrated to Windows 7 both 32-bit and 64-bit.  It 
					requires service pack 1 or higher of "dotnet 2".  
					There	have been numerous bug fixes and small refinements that I will not detail here.
					
		Caution:	Please backup old Tripoli files before opening them with version 4.6.  Once .trip files
					are saved with this new version, older versions will not open them reliably.  
					
		Community:	Thanks to the support of this community, I have been able to fund a small lab and
					maintain a website to support users of Tripoli and ET_Redux.  The lab is called the
					"Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences" (CIRDLES).
					The URL is https://cirdles.cs.cofc.edu . (self-signing, so ignore browser warnings)
									
		Feature:	Tripoli now supports corrections for isobaric interference based on standard models
					of isotope abundance for Barium Phosphate and Thalium.  The mathematics by Noah
					McLean can be viewed by clicking the "Explanation" button on the window that appears
					under the menu item "Settings / BaPO2 and Tl Isotopic Composition."		
					
		Feature:	Tripoli now supports the concatenation of raw data files, based solely on the internal
					time stamp of the file.   To use this feature, use multi-select (control-click) to choose more
					than one file at a time.  Tripoli will complain if the sample and fraction names don't match.
					
		Feature: Tripoli reads ID TIMS Thermo-Finnigan Mat 261 '.txt' data files.
					
		Feature: Tripoli reads IDTIMS data from a ".csv" file.  The template for this file is accessed through 
					the Resources / Tools menu.
					
		Feature:	We have introduced the notion of Live Workflow to both Tripoli and ET_Redux.  The
					basic idea is to support the automatic processing and transmission of data whenever
					possible.  With this version, we implemented Live Workflow for ID-TIMS.  The user manages
					Live Workflow for Tripoli using the Tripoli Control Panel and the Live Workflow Folders menu.
					
					Tripoli automatically loads the newest raw data file from the specified Live Workflow data folder. 
					Tripoli updates to include the new data.  If the data file name includes "temp", Tripoli saves a 
					Tripoli file in the Live Workflow data folder, otherwise Tripoli prompts for a location.
					
					Tripoli provides 2 modes of Live Workflow
					1.  Managed Live Workflow:  When you use  ET_Redux to manage your workflow, it writes a folder named 
					    "SampleMetaData" that tells Tripoli  where to automatically export data for ET_Redux.  
					    Use the Live Workflow Folders menu to specify the location of the SampleMetaData folder.       
					    
					2.  Simple Live Workflow:  Tripoli does not automatically export data for ET_Redux.  To use this mode, 
						 check the option "Simple Live Workflow: ignore SampleMetaData" from the Live Workflow Folders menu.
						 
					Both Simple Live Workflow (the old way) and Managed Live Workflow are accessed through the Tripoli Control Panel, 
					which appears when Tripoli starts, but can also be accessed through the Control Panel menu item.  When
					Live Workflow is not active (default condition), Tripoli behaves as usual, although some of  the menu items
					have been moved and/or renamed.  Check the Control Panel menu in the main Tripoli window for most moved items.
						

28.April.2008: Release 4.5.6.3
		Update:		Tripoli now exports to Redux the additonal Pb ratios 207_204, 208_204, 204_205.
		Bugs:		Miscellaneous graphical bugs repaired.

13.April.2008: Release 4.5.6.1
		Revision:	The xml output to ET_Redux was modified.

05.April.2008: Release 4.5.6.0
		Update:     Uranium cycle-by-cycle fractionation correction has been ugraded.  For Tracer type =
					'mixed 202-205-233-235' or 'mixed 205-233-235,'  Tripoli proceeds as follows:
						1. user enters values for the following U Sample Components
							(available also from Settings menu with default values):
							a. lab U blank mass
							b. 238U/235U blank
							c. 238U/235U sample
							d. tracer mass
							e. molar mass of 235U
							f. molar mass of 238U
						2. Calculate moles of U238 blank, U235 blank, U235 tracer, U233 tracer, U238 tracer
						3. Calculate alphaU (see document at: https://......)
						4. Apply corrections to 238/235, 233/235, 238/233
						5. Create a new ratio "1 + alphaU" to allow easy viewing of the pointwise alphaU
						    using Tripoli
		
		Note:		Additional Uranium fractionation with other tracer types is in the works.
					(Send us your data !!)
					
		Feature:    Tripoli now provides for the fractionation correction cycle-by-cycle of Pb.
					When Tracer type = 'mixed 202-205-233-235' or 'mixed 202-205-233-236,' then
					for each cycle, alphaPb = (1/3)*(1 - (r202_205t / r202_205m).  Each lead ratio
					is corrected point-by-point and appears as a new ratio displayed under the
					original ratio.  In addition, the alphaPbs are preserved in a new ratio called
					'1 + alphaPb' that contains each alphaPb plus 1 (to prevent negative values.)
					Currently, Tripoli corrects: 206/204, 207/204, 208/204, 206/207, 206/208,
					                             204/205, 206/205, 207/205, 208/205.
					Tripoli provides for the export of these ratios to ET_Redux.
					
		Bug:    Oxide correction of Sector 54 files sometimes failed.  Corrected in this version.

15.January.2008: Release 4.5.5.0
		NEWS:		With this release of Tripoli, I am changing the licensing to Shareware.  There 
					are no fees for using this software.  Please contribute what you can, as I continue
					to develop the software as a community service.  Cheers, Jim Bowring
					
		ALERT:		If your uranium ratios do not automatically oxide-correct or if U-fractionation
					correction does not automatically become available, it is because Tripoli
					has learned to recognize ratio names based on the idioms of the MIT lab.
					Please send exemplar files to bowring@gmail.com so that we may learn how you
					and/or your machine name ratios and thus have Tripoli recognize them.
					
		Announce:	This release of Tripoli provides access to the official EARTHTIME website,
					www.earth-time.org and automatically makes EARTHTIME's official tracer
					repository available to Tripoli users via the program.  The XML versions of these
					tracers can be found at: 
					http://www.earth-time.org/projects/upb/public_data/EARTHTIME_tracers/XML
					
		Note:		The changes in this version are a result of a meeting at MIT on 5.October.2007
					with Jim BOwring, Noah McClean, Blaire Shoene, and Sam Bowring to detail
					the next set of featuresa for ET_Redux.  One major result was a re-thinking
					of how values would be stored so as to aid in the understanding and tracking of
					the propagation of uncertainties.  Consequently, some data structures and 
					XML shema were changed to reflect these improvements. One immediate consequence 
					is that previously fractionation-corrected files saved as Tripoli WorkFiles are
					not compatible with this version.  The solution is to open the files in the previous
					version, remove the fractionation correction and re-save the Tripoli file.
					Then open the file with this version, import the tracer, and fractionate and save.
					
		Bug:		Fixed graphs so controls are synched as well as data and graph.
		
		Upgrade:	Tripoli now computes a new ratio 238/233 OxideCorrected by division when 238/235 and
					233/235 are present due to oxide correction by Tripoli.  This new ratio
					can then be fractionation-corrected using the alphaU calculated on a point by
					point basis for the fractionation correction of the 238/235 and 233/235 from which
					it was calculated.  The fractionation correction multiplies each datapoint
					by (1 + 5*alphaU), alphaU also point-specific.
					
		Feature:	The lower left corner of the main Tripoli window contains a small black box.
					The box will display "A" if the Tripoli Work File is annotated with anything 
					other than "" or "Notations" .  Also, annotation capability has been added
					to history files.
					
		Feature:	We introduce the KwikiExporter (named by Blair Shoene in honor of The Simpsons.)
					This version of KwikiExporter writes to the clipboard the mean and standard error
					for each needed ratio in a way that allows immediate pasting to PbMacDat 2.  The
					order is specified by Noah McLean as:
							206/204, 206/207, 206/208, 206/205, 238/235, 233/235
					Missing ratios are elided, and the reported ratio names are listed in a 
					pop-up message created when the user presses the report button on KwikiExporter.
					Thus, if the lead ratios are present, they will appear in the clipboard.  Likwise
					for the uranium ratios.  If the user has selected more than one ratio of the same
					name, only the first found is used.
					KwikiExporter is launched from the Export menu.	

21.August.2007: Release 4.5.3.1
		Upgrade:	The license key is changed in this version to increase security and to adapt to
					a change in windows.  Your license will reset to 45 days and you will need to 
					contact bowring@gmail.com with the new code for a lease extension matching or
					exceeding your previous lease.

19.August.2007: Release 4.5.3.0

		Bug:		Trapped potential divide by zero when missing data points during fractionation correction
					(thanks to Noah McLean)
              
06.June.2007: Release 4.5.2.6
		Bug:		Now, while reading ThermoFinniganTriton data files, trailing partial as well as empty lines 
					are ignored and do not cause an error.  

04.June.2007: Release 4.5.2.5
		Change:		Fixed parsing of ThermoFinniganTriton .exp files to help with pairing of Uranium ratios
					for fractionation correction.  For now, the user must make the contents
					of the string in parens equal for each pair:  was: '(1)' and '(2)' for example and 
					now must be '(1)' and '(1)'  or '(xxx)'  and '(xxx)'.  Improvements to follow.

03.June.2007: Release 4.5.2.4
		Bug:		Fixed naming and pairing of oxide-corrected fractions
		Change:		Added warning if export attempted without saving workfile
	
03.June.2007: Release 4.5.2.3
		Change:		The mean alphaU reported with an export to ET_Redux is now the mean of the selected
					data.  The mean for all the data is still reported in the tracer menu item 
					'Show Fractionation Report ...'
		Bug:		The oxide correction is now only performed on good data (> 0).  THis prevents
					division by zero.

30.May.2007: Release 4.5.2.1
		Bug:		Fixed graph rendering problem with automatically oxide-corrected ratios
		Bug:		Fixed issue with settings so that only numeric values may be entered
	
29.May.2007: Release 4.5.2.0
		Change:		ALERT: Please remove the fractionation corrections from any saved Tripoli WorkFiles
					because this version will not open previously corrected versions.
		Feature:	Oxide correction using r18O_16O is automatically performed upon read-in of data.
					If you want a different value than 0.002, change the default under settings and 
					re-import your raw data.
	        
22.April.2007: release 4.5.1.5
		Change:		The date format of the Tracer certified date is changed to yyyy-mm-dd
					from the full date and time.  The Earth-Time tracers and schema have 
					also been changed.  If you get a parser warning when you open a locally
					save Tracer, merely re-save it and the error will self-correct.
		Change:		In preparation for Earth-Time.org's release of ET_Redux, Tripoli exports
					an xml file of selected ratios for use by ET_Redux.

10.April.2007: release 4.5.1.1
		Bugs:	Minor bug fixes with export functionality

06.April.2007: release 4.5.1.0
		WARNING:	Due to an upgrade in Microsoft's dotNet virtual operating system, any
					files saved by this version of Tripoli will not open with previous versions
					of Tripoli ==> Backup your files if you think you may revert.
	         
		Change:		GRAPHS: The term outlier has been replaced by the term "discard" to emphasize the
		  				recommended practice of first discarding whole blocks of data because of
						equipment start-up, burnoff and shakedown effects.  The blocks can be 
						discarded easily in the graph by right-clicking a block.
	
		Feature:	GRAPHS: Improved the toolset for graphs to include the following:
					1. View a histogram overlay of the data with a bin count chooser (refined)
					2. Allow the user to Include, Ignore, or Hide the discards on a graph
					3. Allow the user to discard manually (default) or by using once either
						of a 2-sigma discard or an application of Chauvenet's Criterion.  Chauvenet's
						criterion can be set under the Settings menu of Tripoli.  There is also
						a link to an explanation of the calculations in the same menu popup.
						The discards created by each of these techniques are shown as circled
						red points. 
					4. RECOMMENDATION: to prepare to use the 2-sigma or Chauvenet method, 
						it is recommended that you discard only whole blocks 
						(right mouse click the block.)
					5. Allow the user to disable the auto-calculation of statistics by
						clicking a checkbox.  The mean is drawn as a red line to warn the
						user that the statistics are stale.  Exception: Chauvenet's Criterion
						is disabled when auto-calc is disabled as the Criterion depends on 
						successive re-calculations of the statistics.
					6. Added menu item to graphs under "Graph/Stats Detail" that allows user
		 				to select whether shaded 2-sigma and sigma are shown (refined.)
		 		   
		Feature:	Provide for the use of Tracers to calculate fractionation corrections for Uranium.
					When a data set is loaded into Tripoli, it is scanned for pairs of
					238/238 and 233/235.  If at least one pair exists, then Tripoli enables the
					Tracer menu.  The Tracer menu provides for using standard tracers provided
					by Earth-Time.org or for creating and saving your own tracers.  In addition,
					the Settings menu allows you to set the gravimetric ratio r238_235g that is
					used in the fractionation correction calculations.  Under the Tracer menu, once
					a tracer is made active, fractionation corrections can be applied to the
					uranium pairs.  These can be reversed as well if you choose to use another
					tracer or a different gravimetric value.  The Tracer menu also provides a report
					for the paired ratios and if they have been corrected, reports the mean alphaU
					as well as the Tracer name and gravimetric ratio.
			 
		Feature:	Provide access to some of the public resources of Earth-Time.org including
					a data-dictionary for U-Pb and Tracer specifications.  See the menu
					item Earth-Time.org.
			 
		Bug re:		Importing .dat files no lnger uses the first block to determine the
					data counts.  Rather it pre-scans the data and accommodates missing
					points in every block.  Thanks to Matt Rioux at MIT for finding this.
	         
		Feature:	Provide for the export to tab-delimited format of all checked ratios.
					See menu item Export.
