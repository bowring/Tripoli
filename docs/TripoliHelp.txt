Tripoli v. 4.6  (March 2010)

Copyright 2004-2010 James F. Bowring

News: Version 4.6 introduces a number of important improvements.
	  Please see Revisions History from Help menu for a detailed listing of these changes.

	  Version 4.6 introduces Live Workflow:
			We have introduced the notion of Live Workflow to both Tripoli and U-Pb_Redux.  The
			basic idea is to support the automatic processing and transmission of data whenever
			possible.  With this version, we implemented Live Workflow for ID-TIMS.  The user manages
			Live Workflow for Tripoli using the Tripoli Control Panel and the Live Workflow Folders menu.

			Tripoli automatically loads the newest raw data file from the specified Live Workflow data folder. 
			Tripoli updates to include the new data.  If the data file name includes "temp", Tripoli saves a 
			Tripoli file in the Live Workflow data folder, otherwise Tripoli prompts for a location.

			Tripoli provides 2 modes of Live Workflow
			1.  Managed Live Workflow:  When you use  U-Pb_Redux to manage your workflow, it writes a folder named 
				"SampleMetaData" that tells Tripoli  where to automatically export data for U-Pb_Redux.  
				Use the Live Workflow Folders menu to specify the location of the SampleMetaData folder.       

			2.  Simple Live Workflow:  Tripoli does not automatically export data for U-Pb_Redux.  To use this mode, 
				check the option "Simple Live Workflow: ignore SampleMetaData" from the Live Workflow Folders menu.
			 
			Both Simple Live Workflow (the old way) and Managed Live Workflow are accessed through the Tripoli Control Panel, 
			which appears when Tripoli starts, but can also be accessed through the Control Panel menu item.  When
			Live Workflow is not active (default condition), Tripoli behaves as usual, although some of  the menu items
			have been moved and/or renamed.  Check the Control Panel menu in the main Tripoli window for most moved items.
	
	
						
ID TIMS Datafile:
	Any legal MassLynx excel file containing counts

		OR

	Any legal Sector54 '.dat' file containing counts.

		OR

	Any legal ThermoFinniganTriton '.exp' file containing counts. (Assumes 20 cycles per block)
		The graphs for these files show the "X" values as red outliers initially
		so that the user can view the data accepted by the ThermoFinniganTriton software,
		but can unselect any or all of these for inclusion.  "D" values will
		be displayed as missing on the x-axis with a red tick.
		
		OR
		
	Any legal Thermo-Finnigan Mat 261 '.txt' Data File
	
		OR
		
	Any ".csv" file conforming to the IDTIMS template found at Resources / Tools menu.

Tripoli WorkFile: 
	A Tripoli WorkFile stores the current state of your work on a datafile.


DataFolder:
	Any folder containing GV gains files in excel named "CCGains*.xls", where * is wildcard.
		The files are checked for errors and then presented in ascending historical
		order.  By selecting a file, you choose to include it in the history, 
		The Faraday gains collectors graphs show this history from left to right.
		
		OR

	Any folder containing standards as tripoized (.trip) files.  This feature is in progress as
		of 12.2005.  In order for the aquisition data to be correctly extracted, the
		original excel (Masslynx) files should be in this folder as well. 

Tripoli HistoryFile:
	A Tripoli HistoryFile stores the current state of your work on a DataFolder.
	Opening a HistoryFile does not refresh the contents of the folder.
	To refresh the contents of a folder, use the DataFolder menu item
	and Tripoli will use the existing HistoryFile or prompt you for one.
	(see DataFolder above)

Drag and Drop:
        Any legal Tripoli file or initialized Tripoli history folder can be dragged and 
        dropped onto the Tripoli window and it will automatically open


Status Bar at bottom of window:
	Double click it to open the displayed file or folder in its native environment.


Graphs: 
        Data graphs: 
                use left mouse to toggle outlier status of points
                use right mouse to toggle outlier status of blocks (minority wins)
                toggle calculation of statistics with auto-calculate checkbox
                overlay histogram by choosing 5, 10, 15, 20 bins (0 bins = no histogram)

        History graphs: 
                use right mouse to select file for removal


Notes: 
	Tripoli files (*.trip, *.triphis) are completely portable when opened with Tripoli.
		Be sure to SAVE your work as a Tripoli file.

	Any Tripoli file can be annotated using the Annotate menu button.

	You can drag and drop onto Tripoli any files of type .trip. .triphis, .xls, .dat, .exp
		and Tripoli will open the file if it is a legal Tripoli format or data file.
		
	Oxide Correction for Uranium is now performed automatically, if necessary.


Thank you for using Tripoli.
